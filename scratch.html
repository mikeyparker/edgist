  <h1>The world is full of men who live carefully—<br>tiptoeing through life as though the goal is to arrive safely at death.</h1>
  <p>This is a record of reinvention—from former millionaire to starting again, off the beaten path. No filters. No safety nets. Just truth, risk, and building a new life at the edge.</p>

<section class="about">
  <h2>This is not that story.</h2>
  <p>I had it all—The house. The cars. The kids in private school. And then, I lost it. Addiction. Divorce. Collapse.</p>
  <p>What followed was the best thing that ever happened to me: I let go. Of control. Of the illusion of safety. Of everything that wasn’t real. And now, I’m building again. Not chasing success, but truth. Not chasing approval, but meaning.</p>
  <blockquote>
    To speak truth is to risk judgment. <br>
    To act without waiting is to risk failure. <br>
    But beyond fear lies freedom.
