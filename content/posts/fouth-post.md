# The New Space Economy: Beyond Government Programs

*[March 10, 2025](https://edgist.com/new-space-economy) • Future Frontiers • Episode 21*

How private enterprise is revolutionizing access to space and creating entirely new industries

## Highlights

- "The great irony is that space turned out to be the perfect laboratory for capitalism—low regulation, no legacy infrastructure, and enormous opportunity for those willing to take risks." —Sarah Chen
- "We're witnessing the creation of the first true off-world economy. When historians look back at the 2020s, this transition will be seen as more significant than most people currently realize." —Sarah Chen
- "The cost to orbit has fallen by 95% in a decade. That's not incremental change—it's a phase shift that enables entirely new categories of business." —Sarah Chen
- "Space manufacturing isn't just about making things in space—it's about making things that can only be made in space. The material science breakthroughs coming from microgravity environments will transform industries on Earth." —Sarah Chen

## Episode Description

In this episode, we explore the rapidly evolving commercial space industry with Sarah Chen, who spent seven years as an engineer at SpaceX before founding Lunar Resources Corporation, a startup focused on extracting and utilizing resources from the Moon. Chen shares her unique perspective on how decreased launch costs have triggered a cascade of innovation across multiple sectors, from communications and Earth observation to manufacturing and resource utilization. We discuss the current state of the industry, the challenges that remain, and her vision for humanity's future as a spacefaring civilization.

## Transcript

**Host**: Let's start with the big picture. How would you characterize the state of the space industry today compared to when you first entered the field?

**Sarah**: It's utterly transformed. When I started my career, space was still primarily the domain of government agencies and a handful of large defense contractors. Today, we have hundreds of space startups raising billions in venture capital, multiple companies routinely launching rockets, private space stations being built, and realistic plans for lunar and Martian operations.

What's happened is a fundamental shift in the economic equation. When launch costs were $20,000 per kilogram, the only viable business models were high-value communications satellites and government-funded science and defense. At $2,000 per kilogram, which is where we are now, and heading toward $200 per kilogram later this decade, entirely new categories of space-based business become not just possible but highly profitable.

**Host**: What are some of those new business models that you find most promising?

**Sarah**: There are several layers to the emerging space economy. The first wave was about improving services on Earth—better satellite communications, more detailed Earth observation, that sort of thing. That market is maturing quickly.

The second wave, which we're in the middle of now, involves in-space services—satellite servicing, debris removal, and the beginnings of in-space manufacturing. Companies are learning how to build, maintain, and operate complex systems in orbit.

The third wave, which my company is focused on, is about utilizing the resources of space itself. The Moon has vast quantities of oxygen, silicon, aluminum, iron, and titanium. It also has water ice in permanently shadowed craters that can be converted to rocket fuel. And it has areas that receive almost continuous sunlight, perfect for solar power generation.
