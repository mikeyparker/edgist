title: "Toward the Edge: Consciousness at the Horizon"
author: Mike Parker
date: 2025-09-06

description: A reflection on consciousness, identity, and the quiet cost of becoming. From neural oscillations to quantum choices, from the UK to the open roads of Portugal—this is what it means to leave, to listen, and to try again.
summary: "I left the UK in a motorhome with my wife, unsure what I was moving toward—but certain I could no longer stay. This third part explores what consciousness reveals when you stop pretending: that reinvention isn’t betrayal, and the future doesn’t happen to you—it wakes up through you."

# Reality shifts when you do.
> There is no map. Only movement. Still, something knows. You just have to be quiet long enough to feel it.

## After the Silence

Part One surfaced on June 4th. Part Two unfolded just six days later.

A wedding. A honeymoon. Then a return to the familiar: the startup, the grind, the identity I’d worn for years. I tried to fit back into it. I tried to care. But it didn’t hold.

I built software that I would never use myself. Showed up to meetings. Accepted plans I didn’t believe in, down a path that wasn't mine. So I stepped out—not completely, I continued to work as we travelled and surfed our way down the west coast of Europe. 

On July 25th, I left the UK to explore. France first, northern Spain, then Portugal. A motorhome. My wife. My thoughts. I still don’t know what I’m moving toward. But I know what I’m leaving. And it isn’t just a place.

The questions I’d started this series with — about consciousness, perception, the self — returned. Not with urgency. Not as puzzles to solve. But as companions.

## What Consciousness Reveals

At first, I thought I was writing about the mind. Brainwaves. Neural oscillations. Attention as an operator. Faggin’s vision of subjectivity coded into the fabric of the universe.

But now I see: I wasn’t just trying to understand **consciousness**. I was trying to understand **myself**. Where do I end and the system begins? Where does authenticity collapse into performance?

How long can you ignore the quiet truth that something is no longer working?

Faggin believes consciousness isn’t something that *emerges*.  It’s something that *is* Foundational. The substrate beneath reality. He calls it _the 'I' behind information_ — the root experience from which everything arises. It’s not matter becoming aware.  It’s awareness pretending to be matter.

And if he’s right, then being true to ourselves isn’t a spiritual luxury. It’s an ontological necessity.

The more aligned the structure, the more resonance it holds.  
The more resonance, the more coherence.  
The more coherence, the more consciousness can express through it.

> What if that’s what it means to wake up? Not to learn something new. But to become congruent.

## The Matrix, the Machine, and the Quantum Thread

I’ve always loved *The Matrix*.

Neo’s journey isn’t one of becoming powerful. It’s one of remembering. He doesn’t break free from the machine — he breaks free from the story he’d been told about himself.

That’s what I feel now. I’m not trying to build something impressive. I’m trying to create something **true**, and it's taken me into the second half of my life to wake up to that.

At the edge of all of this, something stranger stirs. It’s parallel possibility. Multiple futures held at once, waiting for me to collapse them into form.

Faggin suggests that **choice** itself — the collapse of uncertainty — is a fundamental act of consciousness.

And if that’s true, then every time we choose to live differently — to leave the known, to disappoint others, to tell the truth — we’re not just navigating life.

We’re altering reality.  
Participating in its unfolding.  
Becoming conscious not just of the world, but **in** it.

Maybe the future isn’t something that happens to us. Perhaps it’s something that wakes up through us.

## The Cost of Becoming

This isn’t a clean break. It’s not easy. Leaving the UK means leaving my young children with their mother. Not forever, but enough that it will change things.

Holidays instead of everyday moments.  
Presence redefined.  
Love across distance.

And still… I feel the need to go because staying would have been its own kind of absence. A version of me smiling through slow erosion. A father available, but fading.

I want my children to see something else:  
That reinvention is not betrayal.  
That freedom often asks for everything.  
That honesty is how we begin again.

## The Unfolding

We don’t know if it will work. But maybe that’s the point.

> Consciousness doesn’t emerge from certainty.  
> It emerges from participation.  
> From choosing, again and again, to be awake to the moment in front of you.  
> From collapsing the wave of what could be into a single step forward.

And so I go.

> I am not the wave that wonders.  
> I am the wondering.  
> I am the man who left — not to escape —  
> —but to come home.

And if you're lost, as I've been, then maybe there's something in this for you.
