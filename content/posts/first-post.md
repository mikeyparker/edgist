# Peter Thiel: The Vindication of Capitalism, Religion, and Technological Progress

*[January 23, 2024](https://nav.al/deutsch-files-iv) • The Deutsch Files • Episode 4*

What the future holds and what we should be optimistic about

## Highlights

- "Libertarians are people who are socially liberal and fiscally conservative, and they don't exist. It's a fake category." —Peter Thiel
- "The idea that there will be a positive-sum technological transformation that will allow for a world of broad-based prosperity was somehow the default for the 19th and 20th centuries. Then there was a subtle shift in our politics, which was away from technology to redistribution." —Peter Thiel
- "The innovation story is a relatively big one. The AI story is so big that it makes the rest of the innovation story in some ways look quite weak. If you told me there are going to be more innovations in other areas, I would want to push back and say that AI is the one area where we're going to see a lot of progress." —Peter Thiel
- "I wouldn't say I'm more optimistic. I would say that the outcome distribution has never been more extreme. Maybe never before have we had a choice between a Western Civilization that's going to be really good and one that's more than ever going to be really bad. And the two are about equally weighted." —Peter Thiel

## Transcript

**Naval**: If we think about the past decade, what have been some of the most important developments that have caught your interest? Do any of them feel under-hyped?

**Peter**: I'm not sure I have a good list of under-hyped ones. I think something that feels quite important is the way everything's gotten more politicized and more polarized in the last decade or more.

Where would we date this? Maybe certainly from 2016 in the U.S., when we had Brexit and the Trump election simultaneously. From being less interested in politics, I'm somehow more interested, even though my rational brain tells me politics is full of derangement and biases.

It's hard to formulate clear thoughts on what's going on in the political domain. But there does seem to have been a lot of change in some form. If I look at mainstream political discourse over the last decade, it definitely feels like a lot of things have shifted.

The discourse over the last 10-15 years seems to have shifted away from free markets, towards anti-capitalism, away from secularism towards greater religiosity, and away from a kind of anti-technology attitude (environmentalism, precautionary principle) towards a more pro-innovation approach.

That's quite a different picture than we had, say, in 2008. I think in 2008, I would have given a diagnosis where our society was too secular, was too capitalist, was not innovative enough. And I think some of those critiques still have a certain amount of purchase, but it does seem like things have shifted.

You have a discourse that's more religious, both on the left and the right, although very different forms of religion. You have a discourse that's less pro-capitalist, especially on the left, but even to some extent on the right. I think the discourse around technological stagnation and innovation has become more explicit, at least at the level of people saying we should be more pro-innovation, even if there are still enormous structural barriers to it.

So that's something I've been tracking. And I don't have firm conclusions, but I think these are some of the ways in which our society has shifted.

**Naval**: Do you see these movements as permanent, or could they be cyclical?

**Peter**: I hope some of the movements are in a good direction. For instance, if we think about the technology discourse circa 2008-2010, there was a lot that was stagnating. But the picture was hidden. We had the iPhone in 2007-2008, which was a big technological breakthrough, but was itself about to hit its own walls. Now, we're looking at things like AI, which are quite promising, even though there's still the question of how much we can make them work.

So I think the discourse—if I start with the technology one—has shifted quite a bit. I think there's a greater awareness that there's been a set of problems in the last half century or so.

But we're always in a place where I think we have to be cautious about making predictions about trends, or how much these things will continue or not. So to come back to your question, I'm not sure how much these trends will continue. But I do think we've had significant shifts.

**Naval**: Is libertarianism on the retreat? Where is it headed?

**Peter**: I don't think we've had as much libertarianism over the last few decades as maybe the libertarians would claim. The libertarian label was always a bit misleading. Libertarians are people who are socially liberal and fiscally conservative, and they don't exist. It's a fake category.

Maybe there are two or three people in the world who have a consistent perspective on this. But mostly, it's people who are socially liberal, fiscally liberal, or socially conservative, fiscally conservative. But I think the libertarian rubric has been in retreat, in some ways for a while, but it's become much more explicit.

The social conservatives at least feel more comfortable talking about a set of social issues, which I think they had to somehow hide from or not talk about in the 1990s and 2000s.

I think on the left, there's less of a need to worship the false gods of economics or capitalism or something like that. It's a more straightforward leftist discourse that's going on. Whether these are good or bad, there's a way in which I always think there's a more authentic discourse happening today than was the case a decade or so ago.

**Naval**: Regarding the revival of religion, has that surprised you?

**Peter**: I think a decade ago, there was this sort of New Atheist movement, which seemed more dominant and on the ascent in both the U.S. and globally. And that again, maybe seems to have crested.

Religion never really went away, but I do think there's more of an acknowledgment that it's not going to go away. There's Richard Dawkins, Christopher Hitchens—that whole Anglo enlightenment, New Atheism—it had a world where religion was in the process of giving way to science, and that just seems to have retreated as a narrative.

I personally think that both the left and the right have some religious frame. On the left, the woke ideology is deeply Christian in its origins. I would say it's like a Christian heresy in some ways, the way it focuses on equality and inclusion of the oppressed. The way in which it's heretical or bad is that there's no path to redemption. So I think there is a religious sensibility on both the left and the right. It's different forms of religion.

**Naval**: So you would say capitalism, technology, and religion are making a comeback?

**Peter**: I think all of it's complicated.
