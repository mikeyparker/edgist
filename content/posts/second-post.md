# The Future of Remote Work: Beyond the Pandemic Shift

*[March 18, 2025](https://edgist.com/remote-work-future) • Future of Work • Episode 12*

How distributed teams are reshaping organizational structures and what it means for productivity, culture, and innovation

## Highlights

- "The hybrid model isn't a compromise—it's actually the most challenging approach. Fully remote or fully in-office are more straightforward to execute well." —Darcy Barnes
- "What we're seeing isn't just a change in where people work, but a fundamental shift in how we think about productivity, collaboration, and management." —Darcy Barnes
- "The organizations that will win aren't those with the best return-to-office strategy, but those that reimagine work from first principles." —Darcy Barnes
- "Proximity bias remains the single greatest threat to equitable advancement in hybrid organizations. The data is clear—out of sight often means out of mind for promotion considerations." —Darcy Barnes

## Episode Description

In this episode, we sit down with Darcy Barnes, whose research on distributed teams predates the pandemic by over a decade. Barnes shares insights from studying organizations that have successfully transitioned to remote-first models and identifies the common pitfalls that cause others to struggle. We discuss the technology, policies, and leadership approaches that enable effective remote collaboration, and explore how the next generation of tools might further transform how we work together while apart.

## Transcript

**Host**: Let's start with the big question—are we seeing a permanent shift in how work happens, or will we eventually return to pre-pandemic norms?

**Darcy**: The data is conclusive at this point. We're never going back to 2019. What's fascinating is how the narrative has evolved from "when will things go back to normal" to "what is the new normal going to be." That shift itself tells us something important has changed in our collective understanding of work.

The most interesting organizations aren't asking if they should be remote or in-office. They're asking deeper questions about what kinds of work benefit from synchronous collaboration, what activities need focused attention, and how to design workflows that maximize the benefits of both approaches.

**Host**: What's the biggest misconception you see organizations having about remote work?

**Darcy**: That it's primarily about location. Remote work isn't just traditional work done somewhere else. It requires rethinking almost everything—from how you communicate to how you evaluate performance.

Organizations that just lifted their existing processes and moved them to Zoom are the ones that struggled the most. The companies that thrived approached it as an opportunity to redesign work from first principles. They asked: if we were building this company today, knowing what we know now about technology and human behavior, how would we structure things?

This isn't just about having a good video conferencing setup or project management tool. It's about fundamentally rethinking how information flows, how decisions get made, and how culture gets built when people aren't physically co-located.
