&nbsp;  
I had money.  
Built a company.  
Sold it.  
Made millions.  

&nbsp;  
Big house.  
Fast cars.  
Private schools.  
Endless holidays.  

&nbsp;  
Divorce.  
Addiction.  
Rehab.  
Silence.  

&nbsp;  
I broke.  

&nbsp;  
And in that silence,  
I heard the truth:  

&nbsp;  
*I never wanted any of it.*  

&nbsp;  
So I'm walking away.  

&nbsp;  
To live in a van.  
Work with my hands.  
Write what's real.  
Build things that last.  
Fix what I can.  
Let go of the rest.  
Travel light.  

&nbsp;  
**This is my reinvention.**  
Not a comeback.  
A return.  
To myself.  
*Love was waiting there.*
